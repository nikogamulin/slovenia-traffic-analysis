# Slovenia Highway Traffic Analysis: Statistical Evidence for Infrastructure Expansion

## 🚗 Executive Summary

A comprehensive 5-year statistical analysis of Slovenian highway traffic (August 2020 - August 2025) demonstrating through Bayesian inference and mathematical proof that highway expansion is not a policy choice but a mathematical inevitability.

**Key Finding**: Slovenia's highway network operates at 87% capacity with 3.5% annual growth, mathematically guaranteeing system failure by 2033 without expansion.

## 📊 Research Overview

### Project Details
- **Author**: Niko Gamulin
- **Period**: August 2020 - August 2025
- **Completion**: August 2025
- **Data Volume**: 2.4 million observations from 246 sensors
- **Coverage**: 20 major Slovenian highway segments

### Core Research Question
*Can traffic optimization alone solve Slovenia's highway congestion crisis, or is physical infrastructure expansion inevitable?*

## 🔬 Key Research Findings

### 1. Network Stress Analysis
- **Current Utilization**: 87% average, peaks at 97.8%
- **Traffic Growth**: 3.5% annually (compound)
- **Critical Segments**: Ljubljana Ring, Koper-Ljubljana corridor
- **System Failure**: Projected 2033 without intervention

### 2. Economic Impact
- **Annual Cost**: €2.37 billion (3.88% of GDP)
- **Per Capita Burden**: €1,127/person/year
- **Daily Loss**: €6.5 million
- **Transit Burden**: 2.1× EU average

*Comprehensive breakdown of €505M annual economic costs from highway congestion*

### 3. Optimization Potential
- **Smart Lanes**: 35% capacity increase achievable
- **Cost**: €50M investment
- **Benefit**: €400M annual savings
- **Limitation**: Buys only 5-7 years before saturation

### 4. Mathematical Proof
**Theorem**: Given current capacity C₀=6,600 veh/hr, growth g=3.5%, and maximum optimization α=35%, system failure occurs at t*=8.3 years.

**Conclusion**: Optimization + Expansion dual strategy required for sustainable solution.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 2GB disk space

### Data Requirements
The analysis requires 4 large CSV files (798MB total) that are excluded from Git due to size constraints.

**📥 Download Required Data Files:**
1. **Visit**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1riOSWQYiQdu1_hbxo7-9Cq94ogy9kfEr?usp=sharing
2. **Download** these 4 files to the `data/` folder:
   - `production_merged_vehicle_count.csv` (111MB) - Base traffic counts
   - `production_merged_vehicle_speed.csv` (136MB) - Base traffic speeds  
   - `weather_enhanced_traffic.csv` (288MB) - Weather-integrated dataset
   - `enhanced_traffic_features.csv` (263MB) - Engineered features

**💡 Alternative**: The first 3 files are essential for reproduction. The `enhanced_traffic_features.csv` can be regenerated by running notebook `03_data_quality_features.ipynb`.
