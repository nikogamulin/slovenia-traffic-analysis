# **A Segment-Based Topological Analysis of the Slovenian Strategic Road Network for Congestion Modeling**

## **Section 1: The Slovenian Motorway and Expressway Network: A Strategic Overview**

This section establishes the foundational context of the Slovenian highway system, defines the key terminology used throughout the report, and identifies the major traffic hubs that form the basis of the route analysis.

### **1.1. Network Composition and Governance**

The Slovenian state road network is the backbone of the nation's transportation infrastructure, forming a critical link between Central Europe, the Balkans, Italy, and the Adriatic Sea.1 The most significant components of this network are the high-capacity highways managed by the Motorway Company in the Republic of Slovenia (DARS). As of August 2022, DARS oversees a network of 625 kilometers of motorways and expressways.4 This network is divided into two primary categories: motorways (Slovene:

*avtocesta*, AC), which are dual carriageways with a speed limit of 130 km/h, and expressways (*hitra cesta*, HC), which are built to slightly lower standards with a speed limit of 110 km/h.4

Despite Slovenia's relatively small geographic area of approximately 20,271 square kilometers, its highway system is of major international importance.6 The network's primary corridors, identified by their official designations, facilitate the majority of national and transit traffic. The core of the network consists of five main motorways and several key expressways:

* **Motorways (AC):**  
  * **A1:** The longest and most vital motorway, running diagonally from Šentilj on the Austrian border to the port city of Koper.4  
  * **A2:** Connects the Karawanks Tunnel on the Austrian border with Obrežje on the Croatian border, forming a key northwest-southeast corridor.4  
  * **A3:** A short but crucial link from the A1 at Divača to the Italian border at Sežana/Fernetiči.4  
  * **A4:** Connects the A1 at Slivnica (south of Maribor) to Gruškovje on the Croatian border.4  
  * **A5:** Branches from the A1 at Dragučova (north of Maribor) and runs to Pince on the Hungarian border.4  
* **Expressways (HC):**  
  * **H3:** Forms the northern section of the Ljubljana Ring Road.4  
  * **H4:** Connects the A1 at Razdrto with the Italian border at Vrtojba.4  
  * **H5:** Links the Italian border at Škofije with Koper and the A1 motorway.4  
  * **H6:** Serves as a coastal connector from Koper towards Izola.4  
  * **H7:** A short spur from the A5 to the Hungarian border crossing at Dolga vas.4

### **1.2. Defining Key Network Hubs**

To conduct a meaningful analysis of traffic flow and potential delays, a clear set of source and destination points, or "hubs," must be established. These hubs are selected based on their significance as major population centers, primary economic zones, or international gateways, representing the primary origins and destinations for traffic on the DARS network.

* **Major Urban Hubs:** The analysis designates Slovenia's principal cities as key hubs. Ljubljana, the capital, is the central nexus of the entire network. Other major urban hubs include Maribor, the country's second-largest city located in the northeast; Celje; Kranj; and Novo Mesto.3 These cities are the primary centers for domestic travel and commerce.  
* **Primary Economic Hubs:** The Port of Koper is designated as a critical economic hub. As the nation's only container port, it serves as a vital logistics gateway connecting the markets of Central and Southeast Europe with global maritime trade routes.8 Its direct connection to the terminus of the A1 motorway makes it a primary origin and destination for a substantial volume of international freight traffic.  
* **International Border Crossings (Hubs):** All major motorway and expressway border crossings are treated as hubs, as they represent the entry and exit points for the significant international transit traffic that traverses Slovenia.12 These international gateways are:  
  * **Border with Austria:** Šentilj (A1) and the Karawanks Tunnel (A2).4  
  * **Border with Italy:** Fernetiči (via A3), Vrtojba (H4), and Škofije (H5).4  
  * **Border with Hungary:** Pince (A5) and Dolga vas (H7).4  
  * **Border with Croatia:** Obrežje (A2) and Gruškovje (A4).4

### **1.3. Analysis Framework: The Road Segment**

The fundamental unit for this analysis, designed to align with the client's existing delay data, is the "road segment." For the purposes of this report, a road segment is defined as **the stretch of a motorway (AC) or expressway (HC) between two consecutive, officially numbered or named interchanges, junctions, or exits.**

This definition provides a standardized and granular unit of measurement that is directly tied to the physical infrastructure of the highway network. It allows for the precise mapping of traffic routes and the systematic counting of segments between any two hubs. The official interchange lists for each motorway serve as the definitive reference for identifying these segment boundaries, ensuring that the counts are consistent, verifiable, and directly applicable to quantitative modeling.13

The topology of the Slovenian highway network is best understood as a hub-and-spoke system, with the Ljubljana Ring Road serving as its central, indispensable hub. The two primary arteries, the A1 and A2 motorways, form a cross, colloquially known as the "Slovenski avtocestni križ" (Slovenian motorway cross), that intersects at the capital. The A1 motorway provides the main connection from the northeast (Austrian border, Maribor) to the southwest (Port of Koper, Italian coast).5 The A2 motorway provides the main connection from the northwest (Austrian border, Kranj) to the southeast (Novo Mesto, Croatian border).5 These two corridors intersect at the

**Kozarje Interchange** (western junction) and the **Malence Interchange** (southeastern junction) on the Ljubljana Ring Road.13 Consequently, nearly all major cross-country and international transit routes—such as from Austria (Villach) to the Port of Koper, or from Maribor to Croatia (Zagreb)—are funneled through a portion of the Ljubljana Ring Road. This configuration makes the capital's bypass system the most critical and, simultaneously, the most vulnerable component of the entire national network. Any congestion or disruption on its constituent segments will have a disproportionately large, cascading impact on traffic flow across the country and along vital pan-European corridors.

## **Section 2: Route and Segment Analysis by Monitoring Point**

This section provides a detailed, counter-by-counter breakdown of the Slovenian highway network. For each of the 19 specified monitoring points, the analysis first precisely locates the counter on the DARS network. Following this, an exhaustive analysis of all plausible source-destination routes passing through that point is presented, complete with a definitive count of highway segments and a detailed description of the segment pathway.

### **2.4. Celje-Velenje**

* **Location:** This monitoring point does not lie directly on a motorway. It tracks traffic on the arterial road network connecting the city of Celje with the industrial city of Velenje. For traffic utilizing the DARS network, this involves traveling on the **A1 motorway** and exiting at either the **Žalec interchange (Exit 16\)** or the **Šempeter interchange (Exit 17\)**. From these exits, traffic proceeds on regional roads (G4 from Žalec, R694 from Šempeter) to reach Velenje.13 The segment analysis therefore counts the number of motorway segments required to reach the most logical exit point.

### **2.13. Maliska HC**

* **Analyst's Note:** The counter name 'Maliska HC' does not correspond to any officially recognized location, interchange, or settlement within the DARS highway network based on available documentation.12 However, given its critical position in the provided list and the supreme importance of the  
  **Malence Interchange (Razcep Malence)**, it is concluded with high confidence that 'Maliska' is a typographical error for 'Malence'. The Malence Interchange is the southeastern cornerstone of the Ljubljana Ring Road, where the A1 and A2 motorways intersect. It is the single most critical junction for all traffic flowing between the coastal/southwestern regions (Koper, Italy via A1) and the southeastern regions (Novo Mesto, Croatia via A2). The analysis will proceed under this well-founded assumption.  
* **Location:** The **Malence Interchange** is the full Y interchange forming the southeastern junction of the Ljubljana Ring Road, connecting the A1 and A2 motorways.13

    * **Segment Pathway:** Ljubljana (Kozarje Interchange) → A1 → Brezovica pri Ljubljani → Vrhnika → Logatec → Unec → Postojna → *... (follows Route 1 pathway)...* → Srmin Interchange (end).

### **2.19. Velenje-Maribor**

* **Location:** Similar to 'Celje-Velenje', this counter monitors traffic on the arterial roads connecting Velenje to Maribor. For traffic using the DARS network, this involves traveling from Velenje on regional roads to access the **A1 motorway** (likely at the Žalec or Slovenske Konjice interchanges) and then proceeding north towards Maribor. The segment analysis counts the motorway portion of this journey.  
* **Routes and Segment Analysis (on A1):**  
  * **Route 1: Velenje (via A1 Žalec entry) → Maribor**  
    * **Total Segments on A1:** 6  
    * **Segment Pathway on A1:** Žalec (entry) → A1 → Celje-center → Celje-vzhod → Dramlje → Slovenske Konjice → Slovenska Bistrica-jug → Slovenska Bistrica-sever → Fram → Slivnica Interchange (end).  
  * **Route 2: Velenje (via A1 Žalec entry) → Austria (Graz via Šentilj Border)**  
    * **Total Segments on A1:** 11  
    * **Segment Pathway on A1:** Žalec (entry) → A1 → *... (follows Route 1 pathway to Slivnica)...* → A1 →... → Maribor-sever → Šentilj Border (end).

The analysis of these monitoring points reveals a clear distinction between counters located on the main transit corridors (e.g., Koper-Ljubljana, Celje-Maribor) and those monitoring traffic to or from secondary hubs that require travel on regional roads to access the motorway network (e.g., Celje-Velenje). Furthermore, the differentiation between the "Ljubljana Ring" and "Ljubljana Bypass" is critical for modeling. The "Bypass" counters on the A1/A2 southern and western sections are more indicative of disruptions to pan-European freight and tourist traffic. In contrast, the "Ring" counter, which includes the H3 northern expressway, will also capture local, rush-hour commuter congestion patterns that may have different characteristics and require a separate modeling approach.

## **Section 3: Comprehensive Route Segmentation Data Table**

This section presents the primary quantitative output of the analysis in a detailed table. This Master Route Segment Matrix is designed for direct integration into analytical datasets and provides a comprehensive, single-point-of-reference data repository. It contains all primary analyzed routes, their total segment counts, and their constituent interchange pathways, ensuring the data is both verifiable and actionable for advanced congestion modeling. The inclusion of the "Segment Pathway" column provides the underlying logic for each segment count, allowing an analyst to map the route on any GIS platform, validate the count independently, and potentially assign specific delay values to each interchange (node) in addition to the segments (edges) within their model.

## **Section 4: Network Synthesis and Strategic Insights**

This final section transitions from granular segment data to a high-level strategic analysis of the Slovenian highway network. It identifies the most critical components of the system, highlights inherent vulnerabilities, and provides actionable recommendations for enhancing the client's congestion modeling.

### **4.1. Consolidated Segment Count Matrix**

The following summary table provides the total segment count for the most common end-to-end source-destination pairs, allowing for a quick comparison of route lengths in terms of segment complexity.

| Source Hub | Destination Hub | Primary Route | Total Segments |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Austria (Šentilj) | Koper Port | A1 | 30 |
| Austria (Karawanks) | Croatia (Obrežje) | A2 | 24 |
| Ljubljana | Koper Port | A1 | 14 |
| Ljubljana | Maribor | A1 | 15 |
| Ljubljana | Croatia (Obrežje) | A2 | 13 |
| Maribor | Koper Port | A1 | 29 |
| Maribor | Croatia (Obrežje) | A1, A2 | 26 |
| Hungary (Pince) | Koper Port | A5, A1 | 29 |

### **4.2. Critical Corridors and Network Junctures**

The analysis confirms that the **A1 (Šentilj-Koper)** and **A2 (Karawanks-Obrežje)** motorways, forming the "Slovenian Cross," are the undisputed primary corridors carrying the vast majority of national and international traffic. The functionality of the entire network depends on the fluidity of these two arteries.

Within this framework, a small number of interchanges function as critical network chokepoints due to the high number of strategic routes that converge upon them. Any delay at these specific junctures will have a magnified effect on the broader network. These critical junctures are:

1. **Ljubljana Ring Interchanges (Kozarje, Malence, Zadobrova, Koseze):** As established, these four interchanges form the absolute heart of the network. Kozarje and Malence are particularly vital as they connect the A1 and A2 motorways, handling almost all major transit traffic.  
2. **Slivnica Interchange (A1/A4):** Located south of Maribor, this junction is the gateway for all traffic on the A1 corridor heading towards Ptuj and the heavily used Gruškovje border crossing with Croatia.13  
3. **Dragučova Interchange (A1/A5):** Situated north of Maribor, this junction funnels all traffic from the A1 corridor towards Murska Sobota and the Pince border crossing with Hungary, serving as the main connection to Eastern Europe.13  
4. **Razdrto Interchange (A1/H4):** This interchange is the sole high-capacity connection for traffic moving between the primary A1 corridor and the entire Vipava Valley region, including the industrial center of Nova Gorica and the Vrtojba border crossing with Italy.13

### **4.3. Network Vulnerabilities and Ripple Effects**

The Slovenian highway network is characterized by high efficiency due to its direct, cross-shaped topology. However, this same characteristic creates a critical lack of redundancy, particularly in east-west corridors away from the central A1 motorway. A single incident or planned closure on a key artery can therefore cause disproportionately severe and widespread disruption, as alternative routes are often non-existent or consist of low-capacity regional roads.

A powerful case study illustrates this vulnerability: the planned, multi-phase closure of a 10-kilometer section of the **H4 expressway** between the Razdrto and Vipava interchanges for reconstruction.35 This closure does not permit a simple local detour for heavy freight. Instead, all transit traffic over 3.5 tons destined for the Vrtojba border crossing must be rerouted significantly southward. The prescribed diversion forces trucks to continue down the A1 motorway to the

**A3 motorway** and use the **Fernetiči border crossing** near Trieste.36

The consequences of this localized closure are immediate and severe. Projections indicate that this rerouting will increase traffic at the Fernetiči crossing by up to 4,000 additional trucks per day. This surge is expected to cause queues of five to six kilometers and a 42% increase in heavy vehicle crossings at the subsequent Italian Lisert toll barrier on the A4 motorway.36 This demonstrates a significant network fragility: a disruption on the H4 has immediate, costly, and far-reaching consequences for international logistics, impacting infrastructure and causing delays far from the actual closure site. This lack of a parallel high-capacity route means the network has minimal resilience to disruptions on this corridor.

### **4.4. Recommendations for Congestion Analysis**

Based on the topological analysis, the following recommendations are provided to enhance the accuracy and strategic value of the client's congestion model:

* **Prioritize the Ljubljana Ring:** The highest modeling priority and granularity should be assigned to the segments and interchanges constituting the Ljubljana Ring Road. Delays originating here are the most likely to propagate throughout the entire national network due to its central hub function.  
* **Model Interchange-Specific Delays:** While the client's data is per-segment, the analysis shows that the primary sources of non-incident-related congestion are often the complex interchanges themselves. It is recommended to consider modeling delays at the critical junctures identified (Kozarje, Malence, Slivnica, Dragučova, Razdrto) as distinct nodes, as weaving and merging traffic at these points can create bottlenecks that affect multiple incoming and outgoing segments.  
* **Incorporate Directional and Temporal Asymmetry:** Traffic flows are not symmetrical. The model should account for predictable, asymmetric patterns. For instance, morning commuter traffic into Ljubljana and afternoon traffic out of the city will create different delay profiles on the A1 and A2 radials. Similarly, tourist traffic towards the coast (Koper) is heavily concentrated on Friday afternoons and Saturdays during summer months, with return traffic peaking on Sunday afternoons. Routes involving the Ljubljana Ring and the A1 to Koper should be modeled with directional and temporal variables to capture these effects accurately.  
* **Account for Network Vulnerability:** For routes identified as lacking redundancy, such as the H4 corridor, the potential impact of a single segment's delay should be weighted more heavily in the overall congestion model. The H4 case study proves that delays on such corridors cannot be easily mitigated by rerouting, leading to more severe and predictable "worst-case" scenarios that a robust model should capture. Assigning a "vulnerability score" to such segments could significantly improve the model's predictive power.
