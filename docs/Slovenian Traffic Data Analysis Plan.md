# **A Methodological Framework for Analyzing the Slovenian Motorway Network: Diagnosing Stress Factors and Evaluating Solutions Using Advanced Statistical Inference**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

This research plan outlines a comprehensive, multi-faceted analytical strategy to leverage the 5-year DARS QLTCnet3 traffic dataset. The primary objective is to diagnose the principal drivers of network stress on the Slovenian motorway system, culminating in an understanding of the hypothetical "2025 traffic collapse." The plan is structured around seven core hypotheses, investigating the impact of roadworks, international transit, tourism, and traffic incidents. A key feature of this proposal is the deep integration of advanced statistical methodologies, particularly Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, to move beyond simple correlation and establish probabilistic causal links, quantify uncertainty, and provide robust, evidence-based support for policy and investment decisions. The ultimate output will be a series of actionable insights into managing congestion, improving roadwork efficiency, and quantifying the economic toll of delays, thereby creating a roadmap for a more resilient and efficient national transport network.

## **2\. The DARS QLTCnet3 Dataset: A Strategic Asset for Network Analysis**

This section details the foundational data asset for the project, establishing its characteristics and outlining a rigorous plan for data preparation to ensure the validity of all subsequent analyses.

### **2.1. Characterizing the Five-Year Traffic Record: Strengths, Granularity, and Key Variables**

The primary data source for this investigation is a substantial collection of traffic data from the DARS (Slovenian Motorway Company) QLTCnet3 system. The dataset, comprising 47,910 individual CSV files, represents a high-resolution temporal record, with hourly data points, over a significant five-year duration from August 30, 2020, to August 29, 2025\. This temporal depth and frequency, covering 20 major Slovenian road arteries, provide a powerful foundation for robust time-series analysis, enabling the detection of long-term trends, complex seasonal patterns, and critical anomalies.

A key strength of this dataset is its granularity. The data is disaggregated not only by vehicle class but also by individual lane usage. The legenda.txt file is the critical Rosetta Stone for this dataset, allowing for the precise mapping of raw data columns to standardized vehicle classifications.1 For instance, the columns

Vignette\_1 and Vignette\_2 can be aggregated to represent the VV class (vignette vehicles), which serves as a reliable proxy for passenger cars, motorcycles, and light commercial vehicles. Conversely, the Toll\_1, Toll\_2, and Toll\_3 columns, and particularly the specific Trucks\_7.5t column, map directly to the TV (toll vehicles) and HV (heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes) classifications. This distinction is fundamental for dissecting the traffic stream into its constituent parts, a prerequisite for rigorously testing hypotheses related to international transit (Hypothesis 4.2) and tourism (Hypothesis 4.4).

Furthermore, the inclusion of per-lane data, such as Lane\_1, Lane\_2, Lane\_3 and their corresponding speeds (Speed\_Lane\_1, etc.), offers a level of detail far beyond typical aggregate traffic counts. This fine-grained information is invaluable for understanding microscopic traffic behaviors, such as lane choice and speed differentials across the carriageway. This detail is not merely academic; it is the essential ingredient for the high-fidelity calibration of traffic micro-simulation models, a core component of the methodology proposed for evaluating smart lane management strategies (Hypothesis 4.3).

### **2.2. Addressing Data Integrity: A Robust Plan for Handling Missing Observations**

The download report for the dataset indicates a completion rate of 65.6%, which implies that a substantial 34.4% of the potential data points are missing. This level of missingness represents the single greatest threat to the validity and reliability of any subsequent analysis. A naive or simplistic approach to handling these gaps would introduce significant bias into model estimates and could lead to fundamentally flawed conclusions. Therefore, a principled and statistically sound imputation strategy is non-negotiable.

The legenda.txt file provides crucial context that informs this strategy. It lists several status codes associated with data collection failures, including X (Missing records), E (Loop error), P (Power outage), and O (Cabinet door open).1 The existence of these specific error codes strongly suggests that the data is not Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). For example, a power outage (

P) would likely affect all sensors in a geographic area simultaneously, and a maintenance issue (O) could take a sensor offline for a contiguous block of time. This indicates a structured pattern of missingness, where the probability of a data point being missing is related to other observed data (e.g., time of day, location of other outages). This condition is known as Missing at Random (MAR) or, potentially, Missing Not at Random (MNAR).

Given this structure, simple imputation methods such as mean, median, or Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) are statistically inappropriate. These methods fail to account for the temporal and spatial correlations inherent in the data and the non-random nature of the missingness, which would result in biased parameter estimates and an underestimation of variance. Consequently, more sophisticated, model-based imputation techniques are required. This plan proposes a comparative evaluation of two advanced methods to determine the optimal approach for this specific dataset:

1. **Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE):** MICE is a highly flexible and powerful method for handling missing data with complex patterns. It operates by building a predictive model for each variable with missing values, using all other variables in the dataset as predictors. It iteratively cycles through the variables, imputing missing values based on the fitted models until convergence. The strength of MICE lies in its ability to leverage the full multivariate structure of the data; for instance, it can use the complete time-series from adjacent, functioning sensors to generate plausible imputations for a sensor that was offline.2 This spatial correlation is a key feature of traffic data that MICE can exploit.  
2. **Kalman Filtering and Smoothing on State-Space Models:** For time-series data, methods based on state-space models are often superior. A Kalman filter treats the true, underlying traffic state (e.g., traffic volume or speed) as an unobserved variable that evolves according to a system model. It then uses the observed data points to update its estimate of this hidden state. When data is missing, the algorithm simply skips the update step and continues with its prediction based on the system model. A Kalman smoother can then be run backwards in time to refine the estimates, providing the best possible imputation given all available data. Academic literature has shown that for time-series with clear trend and seasonal components, as is common in traffic data, Kalman-based methods can perform exceptionally well, often outperforming other techniques.3

To select the most appropriate method, a hold-out validation test will be conducted. A large, fully complete subset of the data will be identified. Missingness will be artificially introduced into this subset, mimicking the patterns observed in the full dataset (e.g., contiguous blocks of time, simultaneous outages at multiple nearby sensors). Both MICE and Kalman Smoothing will be used to impute these artificial gaps, and their performance will be rigorously compared using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) against the known, true values. The method that demonstrates superior accuracy in this validation exercise will be deployed to process the entire 5-year dataset.

### **2.3. Data Fusion and Preparation: Creating an Analysis-Ready Spatio-Temporal Dataset**

The raw data is delivered in separate vehicle\_count and vehicle\_speed files for each road and day. The foundational step in data preparation will be to fuse these disparate files into a single, unified, and analysis-ready dataset. This will be achieved by parsing and merging the files based on their metadata (road ID, date), creating a single data frame where each row represents a unique spatio-temporal observation (a specific counting station at a specific hour). The primary key for this master dataset will be a composite of Road\_ID, Date, and Time.

Following this fusion, a critical feature engineering phase will be undertaken to derive variables that are essential for traffic flow analysis and hypothesis testing. These engineered features will include:

* **Traffic Density (k):** A fundamental variable in traffic flow theory, density represents the number of vehicles per unit length of roadway. It will be calculated using the fundamental relationship k=q/u, where q is the flow rate (from Total\_All\_Lanes) and u is the space-mean speed (from Avg\_Speed).  
* **Heavy Vehicle Proportion (HVprop​):** This will be a key response variable for analyzing the impact of transit traffic. It will be calculated as the ratio of heavy goods vehicles to the total traffic volume: HVprop​=Trucks\_7.5t/Total\_All\_Lanes.  
* **Temporal Features:** To capture cyclical patterns, a suite of temporal variables will be created from the timestamp, including hour of the day, day of the week, week of the year, month, and year. Additionally, binary flag variables will be created to indicate the presence of public holidays or school holidays, which will be sourced from external calendars.

To ensure clarity, consistency, and prevent misinterpretation throughout the project's lifecycle, a definitive data dictionary will be created. This document will serve as a central reference for all team members, mapping the cryptic column names from the raw files to their official definitions, providing clear descriptions, and specifying their units.

**Table 1: DARS Dataset Variable Dictionary**

| Variable Name (in Dataset) | Mapped Class (legenda.txt) | Description | Unit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Total\_All\_Lanes | \- | Total vehicle flow rate across all lanes at the counting station | vehicles/hour |
| Avg\_Speed | \- | Arithmetic average of vehicle speeds across all lanes | km/h |
| Vignette\_1, Vignette\_2 | VV | Proxy for passenger cars, motorcycles, and light commercial vehicles subject to vignette tolls | vehicles/hour |
| Toll\_1, Toll\_2, Toll\_3 | TV | Proxy for toll-paying vehicles, primarily trucks and buses | vehicles/hour |
| Trucks\_7.5t | HV | A specific subset of heavy goods vehicles with a maximum permissible weight over 7.5 tonnes | vehicles/hour |
| Lane\_1, Lane\_2, Lane\_3 | \- | Per-lane vehicle flow rate, providing insight into lane utilization | vehicles/hour |
| Speed\_Lane\_1, etc. | \- | Per-lane average vehicle speed, essential for micro-simulation calibration | km/h |

## **3\. A Multi-Lens Analytical Toolkit for Traffic System Dynamics**

This section reviews the core methodologies that will be deployed across the various hypotheses. The approach is layered, beginning with foundational exploratory techniques and building towards sophisticated probabilistic and causal models, with a special focus on the Bayesian framework as mandated by the project objective.

### **3.1. Foundational Analysis: Uncovering Patterns with Time-Series Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Visualization**

Before any complex modeling is undertaken, a thorough exploratory analysis is essential to understand the fundamental structure and patterns within the data. This foundational phase will rely on two primary techniques.

First, **Time-Series Decomposition** will be applied to key metrics like Total\_All\_Lanes and Avg\_Speed for major road segments. The objective is to separate these time series into their underlying, unobserved components: a long-term trend, recurring seasonal patterns (both weekly and annual), and the remaining irregular or residual component.6 This process provides a powerful initial diagnosis of the system's behavior. For instance, it can reveal whether overall traffic volume is steadily increasing over the five-year period (trend), quantify the difference between weekday peaks and weekend lulls (weekly seasonality), and measure the impact of summer tourism (annual seasonality). Two complementary methods will be employed:

**STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using Loess)**, which is highly robust and allows for changing seasonal patterns, and **Facebook's Prophet**, a procedure specifically designed for business-style time series that can easily and automatically incorporate the effects of holidays and other irregular events.7 The outputs of this decomposition are critical inputs for Hypothesis 4.4, which directly compares commuter and tourist traffic patterns.

Second, **Spatio-Temporal Visualization** will be used to move beyond analyzing individual time series and understand the network as an interconnected system. Animated maps of the Slovenian motorway network will be created, visualizing the hourly evolution of traffic speed and volume across all counting stations. These visualizations are not merely for presentation; they are powerful analytical tools. They allow for the intuitive identification of recurring bottlenecks (locations that consistently show low speeds during peak hours), the direction and speed of congestion propagation (how a traffic jam on one segment affects upstream segments over time), and the spatial "footprint" of major incidents or roadwork events.

### **3.2. Inferential and Predictive Modeling**

Building upon the exploratory analysis, a suite of standard inferential and predictive models will be developed. This category includes a range of statistical and machine learning techniques designed to predict traffic states and quantify the relationships between different variables. Models will include generalized linear models (GLMs) to establish baseline relationships, as well as more complex, non-linear models such as gradient boosting machines (e.g., XGBoost) for tasks where pure predictive accuracy is paramount. These models will serve as important benchmarks, providing a point of comparison against which the performance and, more importantly, the richer inferential capabilities of the Bayesian models can be evaluated.

### **3.3. The Bayesian Revolution in Transport Analysis: Quantifying Uncertainty and Inferring Causality**

The central methodological thrust of this research plan is the application of Bayesian statistical methods. This choice is motivated by the unique advantages the Bayesian framework offers for analyzing complex, real-world systems like a national transport network.

The core philosophical advantage of the Bayesian approach is its treatment of uncertainty. Unlike traditional frequentist methods that produce a single point estimate and a confidence interval, a Bayesian analysis yields a full posterior probability distribution for any parameter of interest. This distribution represents our complete state of knowledge about the parameter, combining information from the data with any prior knowledge. This allows for direct, intuitive probabilistic statements that are highly valuable for decision-makers. For example, instead of a convoluted statement about a confidence interval, one can state, "There is a 90% probability that this new roadwork strategy reduces total delay by between 30% and 50%." This explicit and rigorous quantification of uncertainty is essential for robust policy and investment decisions.

The computational engine that makes modern Bayesian analysis possible is **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**. MCMC algorithms, such as Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are a class of methods for sampling from complex probability distributions that cannot be solved analytically. By running these algorithms, we can draw thousands of samples from the posterior distribution of our model's parameters, allowing us to approximate it to any desired degree of accuracy. This project will leverage modern probabilistic programming languages like Stan or PyMC, which feature highly efficient and well-tested MCMC samplers, abstracting away much of the computational complexity and allowing the analyst to focus on model specification.

The Bayesian framework is also exceptionally well-suited for **Causal Inference** from observational data, a primary goal of this project.10 In a system where randomized controlled trials are impossible, inferring causality requires making our assumptions explicit. Bayesian methods facilitate this by allowing us to encode our assumed causal structure in the model itself, often using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).12 Key applications in this project will include:

* **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS):** This is a state-of-the-art technique for intervention analysis and is the ideal tool for Hypothesis 4.1 (impact of roadworks).14 A BSTS model estimates the causal impact of an event by modeling the counterfactual—what the time series of interest  
  *would have looked like* in the absence of the intervention. It achieves this by building a state-space model that uses a set of control time series (e.g., data from other, unaffected road segments) to predict the target series during a pre-intervention training period. The model then projects this relationship into the intervention period to create the counterfactual forecast. The difference between the observed data and this counterfactual prediction provides a full posterior distribution of the causal effect of the intervention over time.16  
* **Bayesian Hierarchical Models:** These models, also known as multilevel models, are perfectly suited for studying phenomena across multiple related units, such as the different road segments in our network (Hypothesis 4.2). Instead of assuming that each road segment is entirely independent or that all segments are identical, a hierarchical model treats them as related. It allows parameters (like the baseline proportion of heavy vehicles) to vary by segment, but with the assumption that these segment-specific parameters are themselves drawn from a common group-level distribution. This structure allows the model to "borrow statistical strength" across the segments, leading to more stable and reliable estimates, especially for segments that may have less data.

### **3.4. Simulating Future Scenarios: Calibrating and Deploying Micro-simulation Models**

For evaluating proactive interventions that do not yet exist in the historical data, such as novel lane management strategies (Hypothesis 4.3), simulation is the only viable analytical tool. This project will utilize a standard, industry-accepted traffic micro-simulation platform such as **PTV Vissim** or the open-source alternative **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)**.18 These platforms model the movement and interactions of individual vehicles according to complex behavioral rules.

A simulation model is only as credible as its calibration. An uncalibrated model, which uses default driver behavior parameters, is merely a work of fiction and cannot be trusted to provide reliable predictions about a real-world system. The DARS dataset, with its uniquely granular per-lane data, provides an exceptional opportunity for a high-fidelity calibration process that goes far beyond standard practice.

Typically, micro-simulation models are calibrated by adjusting driver behavior parameters until the model's aggregate outputs (e.g., total hourly flow and average speed) match observed data. With the DARS data, a much more rigorous calibration is possible. We can tune the model's parameters to match not just the aggregate flow, but also the observed lane utilization patterns, lane-specific speed distributions, and the frequency of lane changes. This involves adjusting core behavioral parameters, such as the desired speed distribution, car-following logic (like the Wiedemann model parameters, often referred to by codes like CC1 in Vissim), and lane-changing aggressiveness.18 By ensuring that the simulated drivers behave in a way that is statistically indistinguishable from real Slovenian drivers at a microscopic level, we can create a high-fidelity "digital twin" of key motorway segments. This detailed and empirically grounded calibration process will dramatically increase the confidence and credibility of the results from the "what-if" scenario analyses, transforming them from speculative exercises into robust, evidence-based evaluations of potential infrastructure solutions.

## **4\. Investigating the Drivers of Network Stress: A Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry**

This section forms the analytical core of the project. Each subsection provides a detailed research plan for one of the seven guiding hypotheses, specifying the testable question, data requirements, and the precise methodologies to be employed.

### **4.1. Hypothesis: DARS roadworks are the primary cause of the 2025 traffic collapse.**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** What is the probabilistic causal effect of specific major roadwork events on traffic flow (vehicles/hour) and average speed (km/h) on the affected and adjacent road segments, and can the cumulative impact of these events explain a significant portion of the network degradation observed in 2025?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** The primary response variables will be Total\_All\_Lanes (flow) and Avg\_Speed.  
* **External Data:** The successful execution of this analysis is critically dependent on a high-quality external dataset detailing roadwork events. This dataset must include precise start and end timestamps, geographic locations (road ID, start and end mile markers), and key characteristics such as the number of lanes closed, the type of work being performed (e.g., resurfacing, bridge repair), and the time of day of the closures. Potential sources for this information include public-facing announcements on the DARS promet.si website and, ideally, a structured, machine-readable data feed such as the DATEX II profile for Slovenian roadworks, which is designed for real-time data exchange.19 To isolate the effect of roadworks from other potential confounders, this analysis will also require historical weather data (e.g., hourly precipitation) from the Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) and a calendar of public and school holidays.22  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) for Causal Impact:** This will be the primary analytical method. For each major roadwork event, the period will be divided into a "pre-intervention" phase (the weeks leading up to the start of the works) and a "post-intervention" phase (the duration of the works). A BSTS model will be trained on the pre-intervention data. The model will learn the relationship between the traffic on the target segment (the one affected by roadworks) and a set of carefully selected "control" road segments. These control segments will be chosen based on their geographic separation from the works (to avoid contamination) and their similar historical traffic patterns. Once trained, the model will be used to project a counterfactual forecast into the post-intervention period, representing what the traffic volume and speed *would have been* on the affected segment had the roadworks not occurred. The pointwise difference between the actually observed traffic and this counterfactual prediction provides a time series of the causal impact. The Bayesian nature of the model means this impact is not a single number but a full posterior distribution at each time point, allowing for rigorous uncertainty quantification.14  
  2. **Gaussian Processes (GP) as an Alternative:** As a robustness check, a Gaussian Process model will also be considered. GPs are a flexible, non-parametric approach to time-series modeling.26 The baseline traffic time series can be modeled as a GP with a kernel designed to capture the underlying trend and seasonalities. The roadwork event can then be modeled as a step-change in the mean function of the GP. MCMC methods will be used to infer the posterior distribution of the magnitude of this change, providing an alternative estimate of the roadwork's impact.27 The cumulative effect across all major roadworks will then be assessed to determine their contribution to the overall network degradation.

### **4.2. Hypothesis: Slovenia bears an unfair burden from international transit traffic.**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** Do road segments with high proximity to international borders and major freight hubs (i.e., the Port of Koper) exhibit a statistically significant and economically meaningful higher proportion of heavy vehicle traffic (HVprop​) compared to internal segments, after controlling for underlying factors like road type and time of day/week?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** The primary response variable will be the engineered feature HV\_prop, calculated as Trucks\_7.5t / Total\_All\_Lanes. The counts of Vignette\_X vehicles will be used as a control variable representing domestic and non-freight traffic. Specific road IDs known to serve international traffic, such as 0171 (Bled-Austria), 0161 (Koper Port), and 0011 (Bertoki-Italy), will be explicitly flagged as border-proximate segments.  
* **External Data:** Geospatial data will be essential. A GIS shapefile of the Slovenian motorway network will be used to calculate the network distance of each counting station from the nearest major international border crossing and from the Port of Koper. A list of major international crossings and their operational characteristics (e.g., 24/7 operation, restrictions) will provide additional context.19  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Bayesian Hierarchical Regression:** This modeling framework is perfectly suited to this research question. The proportion of heavy vehicles, HV\_prop, is a value between 0 and 1, so it will be modeled using a Beta distribution, which is appropriate for proportional data. The model will be structured as follows:  
     * **Observation Level:** The proportion of heavy vehicles for a given hour at a given station i (HVprop\_i​) is assumed to follow a Beta distribution, whose mean μi​ is modeled via a logit link function to map it to the real line: logit(μi​)=αj\[i\]​+β∗Xi​.  
     * The term Xi​ represents a vector of fixed-effect predictors that apply to all observations, such as time of day, day of the week, and holiday flags. The vector β contains their corresponding coefficients.  
     * The term αj\[i\]​ is a random intercept for each road segment j. This is the hierarchical component of the model. It acknowledges that observations from the same road segment are correlated and allows each segment to have its own baseline level of heavy vehicle traffic.  
     * **Group Level (The Core of the Hypothesis Test):** The key innovation is to model these random intercepts themselves as a function of a group-level predictor. Specifically, the random intercepts αj​ are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution whose mean depends on the segment's proximity to a border: αj​∼Normal(γ0​+γ1​∗BorderProximityj​,σα2​).  
     * The coefficient γ1​ directly estimates the effect of border proximity on the baseline proportion of heavy vehicles. A positive and statistically credible γ1​ (i.e., a posterior distribution that is concentrated on positive values) would provide strong evidence in support of the hypothesis. The MCMC output will provide the full posterior distribution for γ1​, allowing for a probabilistic statement about the magnitude of the international transit effect.

### **4.3. Hypothesis: Smart lane management would solve our problems.**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** To what extent can specific dynamic lane management strategies (e.g., implementing a reversible lane during the morning peak, or deploying variable speed limits) quantitatively improve network performance metrics such as throughput (vehicles/hour) and average travel time on the heavily congested 0071 (Ljubljana-Kranj) corridor during peak commuter periods?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** The per-lane data is the critical input for this analysis: Lane\_1, Lane\_2, Lane\_3, and the corresponding per-lane speeds Speed\_Lane\_1, Speed\_Lane\_2, Speed\_Lane\_3. This detailed data allows for a uniquely rigorous model calibration.  
* **External Data:** Road geometry data for the 0071 segment is required to build the simulation network. This includes the precise number of lanes, lane widths, and the locations of on- and off-ramps. This information can typically be sourced from DARS engineering departments or derived from high-quality GIS datasets.  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Micro-simulation Model Calibration:** A detailed digital model of the 0071 corridor will be constructed in a micro-simulation platform like PTV Vissim or SUMO.18 The calibration process will be exceptionally rigorous, leveraging the granular DARS data. The model's behavioral parameters—governing aspects like car-following logic (e.g., desired headway) and lane-changing aggressiveness—will be systematically adjusted until the simulation's outputs statistically match the observed, real-world data across multiple dimensions. This includes matching not only the total hourly volume and average speed but also the distribution of traffic across lanes and the per-lane speed profiles. This creates a validated, high-fidelity baseline model that accurately represents current conditions.  
  2. **Scenario Analysis:** Once the baseline model is calibrated and validated, a series of "what-if" scenarios will be implemented and simulated:  
     * *Scenario A (Reversible Lane):* During the morning peak period (e.g., 07:00-09:00), the simulation will be configured so that one of the outbound lanes is reversed to serve the heavier inbound traffic flow.  
     * *Scenario B (Variable Speed Limits / Speed Harmonization):* An algorithm will be implemented in the simulation that detects the formation of congestion (via simulated detectors) and dynamically lowers the speed limits on upstream segments to smooth the flow of traffic and prevent the formation of shockwaves.  
  3. **Evaluation and Comparison:** For each scenario, the simulation will be run multiple times with different random seeds to account for stochastic variation. Key network performance metrics—including total throughput (vehicles successfully traversing the segment), average travel time, and total vehicle-hours of delay—will be collected. These metrics will be statistically compared against the results from the calibrated baseline model to provide a quantitative estimate of the potential benefits or drawbacks of each smart lane management strategy.

### **4.4. Hypothesis: Tourist traffic is making things worse than regular commuting.**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** Can daily traffic volume profiles be algorithmically clustered into distinct, interpretable patterns (e.g., 'Weekday Commuter', 'Weekend', 'Summer Holiday Peak')? Furthermore, does a formal time-series decomposition show that the annual seasonal component, particularly during summer months and school holidays, contributes a greater magnitude to peak traffic volumes than the weekly commuter pattern?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** The primary variables for this analysis are Total\_All\_Lanes and the Vignette\_X counts, which are a strong proxy for the passenger car traffic that includes tourists.  
* **External Data:** Accurate temporal context is crucial. This requires a complete calendar of all public holidays in Slovenia for the 2020-2025 period.24 Even more importantly, a detailed calendar of school holidays is needed.30 The fact that Slovenian winter school holidays are staggered by region (e.g., an "Eastern Region" week and a "Western Region" week) provides a powerful natural experiment.30 This staggering allows for a more precise isolation of the "school holiday tourism" effect. By comparing traffic on tourist-heavy routes (e.g., to coastal or ski destinations) during the week one region is on holiday versus the week the other is, it is possible to control for many time-varying confounding factors (like general weather or day-of-week effects) that would complicate a simple summer-versus-winter comparison.  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Time-Series Decomposition:** Both STL and Prophet will be applied to the long-term time series of Total\_All\_Lanes. The models will decompose the series and allow for a direct comparison of the magnitudes of the different seasonal components. The hypothesis would be supported if the amplitude of the annual seasonal component (peaking in July/August) is found to be larger than the amplitude of the weekly seasonal component (representing the difference between weekday peaks and troughs).  
  2. **Clustering of Daily Profiles:** A more data-driven approach will be used to identify distinct daily patterns. For each day in the five-year dataset, a 24-element feature vector will be created, where each element is the total traffic volume for that hour. This results in a dataset where each point represents a single day's traffic "shape." This dataset will then be clustered. The chosen algorithm will be **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**. Unlike the more common K-Means algorithm, DBSCAN offers two critical advantages for this application: it does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, and it can identify arbitrarily shaped clusters. Most importantly, it can robustly identify anomalous days (e.g., days with major accidents or public events) and label them as noise/outliers, preventing them from distorting the primary cluster shapes.32 The expected outcome is the emergence of distinct and interpretable clusters corresponding to patterns like "Weekday Commute," "Saturday," "Sunday," and "Summer Holiday Peak," which can then be analyzed in detail.

### **4.5. Hypothesis: Why does one accident cause hours of delays?**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** What is the empirical measure of the "capacity drop" phenomenon at an incident site on the Slovenian motorway network? Furthermore, what are the measured propagation speed and spatial extent of the resulting upstream traffic shockwave and the subsequent downstream queue dissipation wave?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** This analysis requires high-resolution data from a sequence of counting stations located both upstream and downstream of an incident site. The key variables are Avg\_Speed, Total\_All\_Lanes, and the engineered Density variable.  
* **External Data:** High-quality incident data is the cornerstone of this analysis. Publicly available aggregate statistics from the Slovenian Police are insufficient for this granular, event-level study.35 The required data must include a precise timestamp, a specific location (roadway and mile marker), severity, and, crucially, the clearance time for each incident. The most viable source for this information is the internal incident log maintained by the DARS Traffic Information Centre (TIC), which is the operational hub that powers the  
  promet.si public information portal.21 Securing access to this detailed, time-stamped operational log is a critical dependency for this part of the project.  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Event Study Analysis:** Adopting the classical event study framework from econometrics, this analysis will center a spatio-temporal window around each confirmed traffic incident.40 "Time zero" will be defined as the moment the incident is reported in the TIC log. A grid of speed, flow, and density data will be constructed, with one axis representing time relative to the incident and the other representing distance from the incident location (differentiating between upstream and downstream stations). By visualizing and analyzing this grid, it is possible to directly observe and measure the key phenomena. The  
     **shockwave speed** (ω), which represents the boundary between queued and free-flowing traffic, can be calculated from the data at two successive upstream stations using the fundamental shockwave equation: ω=(q1​−q2​)/(k1​−k2​), where (q,k) are the flow and density states inside and outside the queue.41 This provides an empirical measure of how quickly the back-of-queue propagates upstream.  
  2. **Queuing Theory Application:** The incident can be modeled as a server in a queuing system where the service rate is temporarily reduced. By measuring the pre-incident arrival rate (qarrival​) from an upstream detector and the flow rate past the bottleneck during the incident (qbottleneck​), we can estimate the queue growth rate (λ=qarrival​−qbottleneck​). This allows for the application of basic queuing models (e.g., an M/D/1 model, which assumes Poisson arrivals and deterministic service times) to estimate theoretical queue lengths and total delay times.43 These theoretical estimates can then be validated against the queue lengths and delays empirically observed in the DARS sensor data, providing a robust, multi-faceted analysis of incident-induced congestion.

### **4.6. Hypothesis: Could roadwork zones be managed better?**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** Which specific roadwork management characteristics (e.g., time of day of lane closures, total duration, number of lanes closed, physical length of the work zone) are probabilistically associated with a lower "congestion score," defined in terms of total vehicle-hours of delay? What are the estimated magnitudes and uncertainties of these associations?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** Total\_All\_Lanes, Avg\_Speed.  
* **External Data:** This analysis will leverage the detailed roadwork schedule database compiled for Hypothesis 4.1, which contains the necessary predictor variables (duration, lanes closed, etc.).  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Congestion Score Calculation:** The first step is to create a single, quantitative outcome measure for each roadwork event. This "congestion score" will be the total vehicle-hours of delay attributable to the event. This can be calculated in two ways. The most rigorous method is to use the output from the BSTS analysis in Hypothesis 4.1, integrating the posterior mean of the causal impact on flow over the entire duration of the event. A simpler, though less precise, alternative is to calculate the delay directly for each hour of the event as Delay \= \\Sigma (\\text{Vehicle\\\_Count} \* (\\text{Free\\\_Flow\\\_Travel\\\_Time} \- \\text{Observed\\\_Travel\\\_Time})) and sum these values.  
  2. Bayesian Regression Model: A Bayesian generalized linear model will be constructed to explain the variation in the congestion score. The model will take the form:  
     $$ \\log(\\text{Congestion\_Score}) \\sim Normal(\\beta\_0 \+ \\beta\_1 \\cdot \\text{IsNight} \+ \\beta\_2 \\cdot \\text{LanesClosed} \+ \\beta\_3 \\cdot \\text{Duration} \+ \\dots, \\sigma^2) $$  
     The natural logarithm of the congestion score is used as the response variable to handle its expected skewness. The predictors are the characteristics of the roadwork, such as IsNight (a binary variable indicating if closures were primarily overnight), LanesClosed (the number of lanes closed), and Duration (in days). The coefficients (β) represent the effect of each characteristic on the congestion score.  
  3. **Probabilistic Interpretation:** By fitting this model using MCMC, we obtain a full posterior distribution for each coefficient β. This enables powerful and intuitive probabilistic conclusions. For example, if the posterior distribution for β1​ (the coefficient for nighttime work) is concentrated below zero, we can calculate the probability that nighttime work is better than daytime work. We can also provide a credible interval for the effect size, such as: "The median estimate for the coefficient β1​ suggests that nighttime-only works reduce the total congestion score by 40% (calculated as eβ1​) compared to daytime works, with a 95% credible interval of \[30%, 48%\]." This provides a direct, actionable, and uncertainty-aware insight for roadwork planners.

### **4.7. Hypothesis: What's the real economic impact of traffic delays?**

* **Reframe as Research Question:** What is the estimated total annual economic cost of both non-recurring congestion (attributable to incidents and roadworks) and recurring daily congestion on the Slovenian motorway network, with costs disaggregated by component (Value of Time for passengers and freight, and excess fuel consumption)?  
* **Key Variables (DARS):** Total\_All\_Lanes, Avg\_Speed, and the disaggregated vehicle class counts (Vignette\_X as a proxy for passenger cars, Trucks\_7.5t as a proxy for freight).  
* **External Data:** This analysis requires the integration of several key economic datasets:  
  * **Value of Time (VoT):** This is the most critical external input, representing the monetary value that users place on their travel time. A single, generic VoT would be a gross oversimplification. Instead, this analysis will use the detailed, country-specific values provided by a comprehensive European-wide meta-analysis.45 This study provides VoT estimates for Slovenia, disaggregated by journey purpose (commuter, business, other) and transport mode, which is essential for a credible economic assessment.  
  * **Historical Fuel Prices:** To calculate the cost of excess fuel consumption, a time series of historical prices for diesel and gasoline in Slovenia is required.47  
  * **Fuel Consumption Models:** Standard engineering models that relate a vehicle's fuel consumption rate (liters/km) to its average speed and acceleration profile will be used to estimate the excess fuel burned during stop-and-go conditions compared to free-flow travel.  
* **Methodologies:**  
  1. **Delay Calculation:** The foundation of the economic analysis is the quantification of delay. For every hour and every road segment in the dataset, the total vehicle-hours of delay will be calculated. This is defined as the difference between the actual travel time and a hypothetical free-flow travel time. Delay \= \\text{Vehicle\\\_Count} \* ((\\text{Segment\\\_Length} / \\text{Observed\\\_Speed}) \- (\\text{Segment\\\_Length} / \\text{Free\\\_Flow\\\_Speed})). The free-flow speed for each segment will be determined empirically from the data itself, for example, by taking the 95th percentile of observed speeds during low-volume overnight hours (e.g., 02:00-04:00).  
  2. Economic Valuation Model: The total economic cost will be calculated by summing the costs across all time periods, road segments, and vehicle classes (i). The model is:  
     $$ \\text{Total\_Cost} \= \\sum\_i (\\text{Delay}\_i \\times \\text{VoT}\_i) \+ \\sum\_i (\\text{Excess\_Fuel}\_i \\times \\text{Fuel\_Price}) $$  
     The vehicle counts will be disaggregated using the Vignette\_X and Trucks\_7.5t columns, and the appropriate VoT will be applied to each class based on the values from the European meta-analysis. The 2010 price-level values from the study will be adjusted for inflation to the relevant year of analysis. This disaggregated approach, which recognizes that the time of a freight truck is valued differently from that of a leisure traveler, is crucial for producing an accurate and defensible final economic impact assessment.

**Table 2: Value of Time (VoT) Estimates for Slovenia (€/hour, 2010 prices)**

| Journey Purpose | Vehicle Class Proxy | Representative Distance | VoT (€/hr, 2010 prices) | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Commuter | Vignette\_X | 25 km | €5.64 | 45 |
| Business | Vignette\_X | 25 km | €17.14 | 45 |
| Other/Leisure | Vignette\_X | 25 km | €4.86 | 45 |
| Freight (Business) | Trucks\_7.5t | 100 km | €20.81 (Car-Business used as proxy) | 45 |

## **5\. Building a Holistic View: A Strategy for External Data Integration**

A successful analysis of the complex traffic system requires enriching the primary DARS traffic data with a wide range of contextual information. The traffic data tells us *what* is happening on the network, but external data is required to understand *why*. This section consolidates the external data requirements identified across all seven hypotheses into a unified acquisition strategy. The following table provides a centralized checklist for the data acquisition phase of the project, outlining what data is needed, its potential source, and which hypotheses it directly supports.

**Table 3: External Data Requirements and Sources**

| Data Category | Specific Data Required | Potential Source(s) | Supported Hypotheses |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Infrastructure Events** | Detailed roadwork logs (location, start/end timestamps, number of lanes closed, type of work) | DARS (promet.si), DATEX II real-time feed 20 | 4.1, 4.6, 4.7 |
| **Safety Events** | Detailed accident logs (location, timestamp, severity, clearance time) | DARS Traffic Information Centre (TIC) internal logs, Slovenian Police (Policija) 21 | 4.5, 4.7 |
| **Meteorology** | Hourly station-level data on precipitation, temperature, visibility, and adverse weather warnings | ARSO (Slovenian Environment Agency) official data archive 22 | 4.1, 4.5, 4.6 |
| **Temporal Context** | Official calendars of national public holidays and regional school holidays for the full 2020-2025 period | GOV.SI, Ministry of Education, Public Calendars 24 | 4.1, 4.4 |
| **Economic** | Disaggregated Value of Time (VoT) by transport mode, journey purpose, and income level for Slovenia | European Commission / JRC sponsored meta-analysis studies 45 | 4.7 |
| **Economic** | Historical time series of retail fuel prices (diesel and gasoline) in Slovenia | SURS (Statistical Office of the Rep. of Slovenia), commercial data providers (e.g., GlobalPetrolPrices.com) 47 | 4.7 |
| **Economic/Demographic** | Annual GDP per capita and population statistics for Slovenia | SURS (Statistical Office of the Rep. of Slovenia), Eurostat 53 | 4.7 (for VoT adjustment) |
| **Geospatial** | Digital representation of the motorway network (shapefiles), locations of border crossings and ports | GURS (The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia), OpenStreetMap 54 | 4.2, 4.3 |

## **6\. Conclusion: Towards a Data-Driven and Resilient Slovenian Motorway Network**

This research plan presents a rigorous, state-of-the-art framework for transforming the DARS traffic dataset from a raw historical archive into a strategic asset for national transport planning and management. By systematically addressing the seven core hypotheses through a carefully selected combination of advanced statistical modeling, probabilistic causal inference, and high-fidelity simulation, this project will deliver an unprecedentedly deep and nuanced understanding of the dynamics of the Slovenian motorway network.

The deliberate and central emphasis on Bayesian methods is a key feature of this plan. This approach will ensure that all conclusions are presented not as misleadingly simple certainties, but as probabilistic statements that transparently communicate the range of likely outcomes and the degree of confidence in each finding. This is a critical feature for enabling robust, risk-informed decision-making in the face of the inherent uncertainty of complex systems.

The findings from this comprehensive analysis will provide DARS and the Ministry of Infrastructure with clear, data-driven evidence to optimize roadwork management strategies, quantify the distinct impacts of international transit and seasonal tourism, evaluate the potential of new traffic management technologies, and understand the full economic cost of both recurring and non-recurring congestion. Ultimately, this work will form the analytical foundation for policies and investments aimed at building a more efficient, reliable, and resilient transport future for Slovenia.
